            <h1>The Best Diet: Quality Counts</h1>

                    <p>Dietary guidelines have changed over the years as research becomes more accurate in determining
                        what we
                        should eat to attain optimal health and weight. The strongest evidence to date shows that
                        calories
                        matter, but focusing on food quality is an equally important part of preventing weight gain and
                        promoting weight loss.</p>
                    <p>Focus on eating high-quality foods in appropriately sized portions.</p>

                <h2>Consider quality, not just calories</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>“A calorie is a calorie” is an oft-repeated dietary slogan, and not overeating is indeed an important
                    health
                    measure. Rather than focusing on calories alone, however, emerging research shows that quality is
                    also key
                    in determining what we should eat and what we should avoid in order to achieve and maintain a
                    healthy
                    weight. Rather than choosing foods based only on caloric value, think instead about choosing
                    high-quality,
                    healthy foods, and minimizing low-quality foods.</p>
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>High-quality foods include unrefined, minimally processed foods such as vegetables and fruits,
                        whole
                        grains, healthy fats and healthy sources of protein – the foods recommended in the Healthy
                        Eating Plate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lower-quality foods include highly processed snack foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined
                        (white)
                        grains, refined sugar, fried foods, foods high in saturated and trans fats, and high-glycemic
                        foods such
                        as potatoes..
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There isn’t one “perfect” diet for everyone, owing to individual differences in genes and
                    lifestyle.As per
                    requirement the diet of also varies from person to person.</p>
                <br><br>

                <h2>Quality Counts</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>One study analyzed whether certain foods were more or less likely to promote weight gain. This type
                    of
                    research examining specific foods and drinks allows us to understand whether “a calorie is a
                    calorie,” or if
                    eating more higher-quality foods and fewer lower-quality foods can lead to weight loss and
                    maintenance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Researchers in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health show us that quality is
                    in fact
                    very important in determining what we should eat to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, and that
                    the
                    notion of “a calorie is a calorie” does not tell the whole story.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a study of over 120,000 healthy women and men spanning 20 years, researchers determined that
                        weight
                        change was most strongly associated with the intake of potato chips, potatoes, sugar-sweetened
                        beverages, and both processed and unprocessed red meats. The researchers concluded that
                        consumption of
                        processed foods higher in starches, refined grains, fats, and sugars can increase weight gain.
                    </li>

                    <li>Foods shown to be associated with weight loss were vegetables, whole grains, fruits, nuts, and
                        yogurt
                    </li>
                    <li>Researchers did not discount the importance of calories, instead suggesting that choosing
                        high-quality
                        foods (and decreasing consumption of lower-quality foods) is an important factor in helping
                        individuals
                        consume fewer calories. (23)

                    weight

                <h2>Managing macronutrients: Does it matter?</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>With the proliferation of macronutrient-based diets over the past several decades, from low-fat to
                    low-carbohydrate, discussion of the three main macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins, and fats –
                    has
                    become standard when talking about optimal diets. Researchers have begun comparing these
                    “macronutrient
                    management”-style diets to one another in order to determine which is most effective, but thus far
                    evidence
                    is largely inconclusive.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One study, published in JAMA in 2007, compared four weight-loss diets ranging from low to high
                    carbohydrate
                    intake. This 12-month trial followed over 300 overweight and obese premenopausal women, randomly
                    assigning
                    them to either an Atkins (very low carbohydrate), Zone (low carbohydrate), LEARN (high
                    carbohydrate), or
                    Ornish (very high in carbohydrate) diet.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>After one year, weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the
                        other diet
                        groups
                    </li>
                    <li>This study also examined secondary outcomes focused on metabolic effects (such as cholesterol,
                        body fat
                        percentage, glucose levels and blood pressure), and found that those for the Atkins group were
                        comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.
                    </li>
                    <li>There was no significant difference in weight loss among the other three diets (Zone, LEARN, and
                        Ornish).
                    </li>
                    <li>This study does raise questions about about long-term effects and mechanisms, but the
                        researchers
                        concluded that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible
                        recommendation for weight loss. (24)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Another study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, challenged the above study’s
                    findings by testing four different types of diets and producing results that showed comparable
                    average
                    weight loss among the different diets.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The study followed 800 people over 2 years, assigning subjects to one of four diets: Low-fat and
                        average-protein, low-fat and high-protein, high-fat and average-protein, and high-fat and high
                        protein.
                    </li>
                    <li>Researchers concluded that all of the diets resulted in meaningful weight loss, despite the
                        differences
                        in macronutrient composition.
                    </li>
                    <li>The study also found that the more group counseling sessions participants attended, the more
                        weight they
                        lost, and the less weight they regained. This supports the idea that not only is what you eat
                        important,
                        but behavioral, psychological, and social factors are important for weight loss as well. (25)
                    </li>
                    <li>An additional study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010, looked at the
                        role of
                        protein and glycemic index upon weight loss maintenance. Researchers first implemented a
                        low-calorie
                        diet to produce weight loss, then examined whether protein and glycemic index impacted weight
                        loss
                        maintenance.
                    </li>
