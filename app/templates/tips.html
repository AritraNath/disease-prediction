                    <br>
                    <h3>Never skip your breakfst</h3>
                    <p>Studies show that eating a proper breakfast is one of the most positive things you can do if you
                        are
                        trying to lose weight. Breakfast skippers tend to gain weight. A balanced breakfast includes
                        fresh fruit
                        or fruit juice, a high-fibre breakfast cereal, low-fat milk or yoghurt, wholewheat toast, and a
                        boiled
                        egg.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Brush up on hygiene.</h3>
                    <p>Many people don't know how to brush their teeth properly. Improper brushing can cause as much
                        damage to
                        the teeth and gums as not brushing at all. Lots of people don’t brush for long enough, don’t
                        floss and
                        don’t see a dentist regularly. Hold your toothbrush in the same way that would hold a pencil,
                        and brush
                        for at least two minutes.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>Bone up daily</h3>
                    <p>Get your daily calcium by popping a tab, chugging milk or eating yoghurt. It’ll keep your bones
                        strong.
                        Remember that your bone density declines after the age of 30. You need at least 200 milligrams
                        daily,
                        which you should combine with magnesium, or it simply won’t be absorbed.</p><br>

                    <h3>I say tomato.</h3>
                    <p>Tomato is a superstar in the fruit and veggie pantheon. Tomatoes contain lycopene, a powerful
                        cancer
                        fighter. They’re also rich in vitamin C. The good news is that cooked tomatoes are also
                        nutritious, so
                        use them in pasta, soups and casseroles, as well as in salads.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>A for Away</h3>
                    <p> This vitamin, and beta carotene, help to boost immunity against disease. It also assists in the
                        healing
                        process of diseases such as measles and is recommended by the WHO. Good natural sources of
                        vitamin A are
                        kidneys, liver, dairy products, green and yellow vegetables, pawpaw, mangoes, chilli pepper, red
                        sorrel
                        and red palm oil.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Do your weights workout first</h3>
                    <p> Experts say weight training should be done first, because it's a higher intensity exercise
                        compared to
                        cardio. Your body is better able to handle weight training early in the workout because you're
                        fresh and
                        you have the energy you need to work it. </p><br>
                    <h3> Burn fat during intervals</h3>
                    <p>To improve your fitness quickly and lose weight, harness the joys of interval training. Set the
                        treadmill
                        or step machine on the interval programme, where your speed and workload varies from minute to
                        minute.
                        Build up gradually, every minute and return to the starting speed. Repeat this routine. Not only
                        will it
                        be less monotonous, but you can train for a shorter time and achieve greater results.</p><br>
                    <h3>Stop fuming</h3>
                    <p> Don’t smoke and if you smoke already, do everything in your power to quit. Don’t buy into that
                        my-granny-smoked-and-lived-to-be-90 crud – not even the tobacco giants believe it. Apart from
                        the
                        well-known risks of heart disease and cancer, orthopaedic surgeons have found that smoking
                        accelerates
                        bone density loss and constricts blood flow. So you could live to be a 90-year-old amputee who
                        smells of
                        stale tobacco smoke. Unsexy.</p><br>
                    <h3>Laugh and Cry.</h3>
                    <p>Having a good sob is reputed to be good for you. So is laughter, which has been shown to help
                        heal
                        bodies, as well as broken hearts. Studies in Japan indicate that laughter boosts the immune
                        system and
                        helps the body shake off allergic reactions.</p>
