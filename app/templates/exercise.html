                    <p>If you are looking at losing weight, developing a strong and flexible body, having beautiful
                        glowing
                        skin, or being at peace, Yoga can help you achieve it all. Yoga is often partially understood as
                        being
                        limited to asanas or poses, and its benefits are only perceived to be at the physical level.
                        However, we
                        fail to realize the immense benefits yoga offers in uniting the body, mind, and breath. When you
                        are in
                        harmony, the journey through life is calmer, happier and more fulfilling..</p>

                    <h2>Top 8 benifits of yoga.</h2>
                    <h3> Yoga for all-round fitness</h3>
                    <p>As Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar puts it, “Health is not a mere absence of disease. It is a
                        dynamic
                        expression of life – in terms of how joyful, loving and enthusiastic you are.” Yoga poses,
                        pranayama
                        (breathing techniques) and meditation are a holistic fitness package. The benefits accrued by
                        being a
                        regular practitioner are numerous. Some very discernible ones are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improves health</li>
                        <li>Gives mental strength</li>
                        <li>Improves physical strength</li>
                        <li>Protects from injury</li>
                        <li>Detoxifies the body</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga for weight loss</h3>
                    <p>Sun Salutation and Kapal Bhati pranayama are highly useful for losing weight. Moreover, with
                        regular
                        practice of yoga, we tend to become more sensitive to our body and its needs. This, in turn,
                        helps keep
                        a check on our food intake and body weight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga for stress relief</h3>
                    <p>A few minutes of yoga during the day can be a great way to get rid of stress that accumulates
                        daily - in
                        both the body and mind. Yoga postures, pranayama and meditation are effective techniques to
                        release
                        stress.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga for inner peace</h3>
                    <p>We all love to visit peaceful, serene spots that are rich in natural beauty. Little do we realize
                        that
                        peace can be found right within us and we can take a mini-vacation to experience this any time
                        of the
                        day! Benefit from a small holiday every day with yoga and meditation. Yoga is also one of the
                        best ways
                        to calm a disturbed mind.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga to improve immunity</h3>
                    <p>Our system is a seamless blend of the body, mind and spirit. An irregularity in the body affects
                        the mind
                        and similarly unpleasantness or restlessness in the mind can manifest as an ailment in the body.
                        Yoga
                        poses help massage organs and strengthens muscles; while breathing techniques and meditation
                        release
                        stress and improve immunity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga for better relationships</h3>
                    <p>Yoga can even help improve your relationship with your loved ones. A mind that is relaxed, happy
                        and
                        contented is better able to deal with sensitive relationship matters. Use Yoga and meditation to
                        keep
                        the mind happy and peaceful and watch how your relations with those around you blossom.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Yoga for better flexibility and posture</h3>
                    <p>Yoga must become part of your daily routine to get a body that is strong, supple and flexible.
                        Regular
                        yoga practice, stretches and tones the body muscles and also makes them strong. It also helps
                        improve
                        your body posture when you stand, sit, sleep or walk. This would, in turn, help relieve you of
                        body ache
                        due to incorrect posture.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3> Yoga to live with greater awareness</h3>
                    <p>The mind is constantly involved in activity – swinging from the past to the future but never
                        staying in
                        the present. By simply being aware of this tendency of the mind, we can save ourselves from
                        getting
                        stressed or worked up. Yoga and pranayama help create that awareness and bring the mind back to
                        the
                        present moment, where it can stay happy and focused.</p>
